Predicting Heart Disease
We've all got to start somewhere. This is one of the smallest datasets on DrivenData. That makes it a great place to dive into the world of data science competitions. Get your heart thumping and try your hand at predicting heart disease.

Heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide, so if you're looking to use data science for good you've come to the right place. To learn how to prevent heart disease we must first learn to reliably detect it.
Our dataset is from a study of heart disease that has been open to the public for many years. The study collects various measurements on patient health and cardiovascular statistics, and of course makes patient identities anonymous.
